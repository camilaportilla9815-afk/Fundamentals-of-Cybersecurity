Exercise 1 - Network-Commands: The network command procedure began by using ip a to identify the interface configuration, establishing the local IP as 192.198.8.113 on the eth0 interface. Subsequently, ip route was employed to determine the gateway (192.168.8.1). Then, the commands netstat -tuln and ss -tuln were used to list listening connections and ports, observing the active services. The connectivity phase included using ping to test the connection with both the router and the local VM, followed by testing the connection to a specific port using nc -zv IP(local) <port>. Finally, the exercise concluded with the use of ss -t to exclusively list the active TCP connections on the virtual machine.


Exercise 2 - ScriptsBash-Backup: The exercise focused on creating a backup automation script using bash. Initially, the nano editor was used to draft the script, where the path variables ORIGIN (/home/camila/Fundamental-of-Cybersecurity) and DESTINATION (/home/camila/backup) were defined, including a mkdir command for the destination. After defining the copy logic with cp -r $ORIGEN $DESTINO/backup-$(date +%F) to name the backup with the current date, the permissions management proceeded: they were modified using chmod +x to grant execution capability. Finally, the script was successfully executed using ./backup.sh, and the correct creation of the new backup folder in the destination was verified using the ls command.


Exercise 3 - ScriptsBash-Search: The exercise focused on creating an automated search script using bash and the grep tool. Initially, the nano editor was used to draft the script, named search.sh, where the variables CARPETA (Directory), set to /home/camila/Fundamental-of-Cybersecurity to specify the search directory, and PALABRA (Word), set to $Network to contain the desired text pattern, were defined. The central search logic was implemented using the command grep -rnw $CARPETA -e $PALABRA. For execution, permission management was addressed by modifying them with chmod +x to grant execution capability. Finally, the script was successfully executed via ./search.sh, completing the task of finding the keyword within the specified directory's files.


Exercise 4 - ScriptsBash-Monitoring: I performed an exercise to create a Bash script, named monitoring.sh, designed to quickly check the status of the system's CPU and RAM. I used the nano editor to write it. Inside the script, I included two key commands: top -b -n 1 | head -n 10 to get a snapshot of the CPU load and the most active processes, and free -h to show the usage of RAM and swap in an easy-to-read format. To make it functional, I granted execution permission using chmod +x monitoring.sh. Finally, I ran it with ./monitoring.sh and was able to view all the information instantly, confirming that the script serves well for diagnosing the system's status.
