Exercise 1: I created a directory structure (project and logs) and files using mkdir and touch. I learned to move files using mv and wildcards (*.log), and practiced access control: I used chmod to set files to "read-only" mode and others to be "executable" only for the user. Finally, I deleted files with rm.

Exercise 2: I created sample files with content using nano and organized them in a folder named data. Then, I used grep to perform advanced searches: I found lines containing the word "ERROR," searched for the word "user" regardless of case (case-insensitive), and counted how many times the word "admin" appeared. Finally, I learned to use sort and its options to order a file's content and display only the unique lines.

Exercise 3: I learned how to list active processes with ps aux, how to filter results using grep, and how to monitor resources in real time with top. I also practiced how to terminate processes manually with kill, and I better understood how to view system statistics (df -h, du -sh, free -m, uptime) to interpret disk usage, memory, and system load.
